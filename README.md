# Project4 Next Generation Tele Traffic Problems

This is a project with the purpose to learn to simulate networking protocols using the NS-3 simulator. I addition a scientific paper on incorperating RL Machine Learning tools into the NS-3 enviroment to optimize and solve problems within the networking environment.
